	In the movement of the planets the orbit of the planet is depicted as an ellipse. The size and rotation of the ellipses are in scale with the solar system and depicted in two dimensions. The planets are depicted in their respective orbits as points of the same size. In the top-left corner of the screen there is a date. In that date the planets had(or have or will have) roughly the position that appears in the simulation.In the begininning the planets have the position of the date the program runs. 

	The user can change the date by pressing the key "n" and giving the date they want as an input (in the dd/mm/yyyy format). The user can also start/pause the movement of the planets by pressing the space bar. The movement of the planet and the date change at a rate "dt". Initially dt is set as 0.02 for the simulation with 8 planets and 0.001 for the simulation with the 4 inner planets. The user can change the rate of the movement by pressing the key "t" and giving the new dt. For example by setting dt as 0.04 in the simulation of 8 planets the planets will move twice as fast as the initial speed. A day (24 hours) corresponds to 0.000577548326205792 so dt=0.04 corresponds to approximately 8 days each time the loop is run.

	Another feature of the program are the missions (see missions.txt for more information) which the user can access by pressing m in the simulation.

 Issues, Assumptions, Simplifications

	The simulation isn't totally accurate and there are a few points where it can be improved. Firstly in the simulation the planets are moving at a constant speed(their average speed). In reality the planets move faster near the Sun and slower when they are away. Also in the simulation their orbits are constant. In reality their orbits also change slightly throughout the years. Lastly the rotation of the ellipses and the initial position of the planets were taken from images so their values are not exact but rather an approximation from observing the images.
